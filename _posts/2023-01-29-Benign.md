# Introduction
Today, we  will be exploring TryHackMe's Benign room found at: https://tryhackme.com/room/benign. This challenge is marked as medium difficulty and involves a short investigation using Splunk. I found the process fairly straight forward. This write-up has been sanitized per TryHackMe's guidelines on answers, flags, and hashes.

> Throughout this challenge, make sure that you are using the correct index: `index="win_eventlogs"`. 
{: .prompt-info }

# Questions
## Q1: How many logs are ingested from the month of March?
All we have to do is specify the index. 
> Upon firing up our Splunk instance for the first time, we might be tempted to enter the search query and just hit enter. However, we have to be a little more specific, since Splunk will default to showing results from the last 24 hours.
{: .prompt-tip }

With the aforementioned query, we will arrive at our first answer. While the question asks for logs ingested for the month of March, we can see that March is the only month in this dataset. The answer is clearly displayed in bold under the search box on the left.

## Q2: Imposter Alert: There seems to be an imposter account observed in the logs, what is the name of that user?
While completing any of these challenges, I like to manually review every field in the "Interesting Fields" pane. Usually, bigger indexes have hundreds or more fields to explore. For this challenge, we have relatively few fields to parse through. The `HostName` and `UserName` fields always seem to be a good place to check in these rooms.

From here, I wanted to see if there were any strange or unusual usernames. Clicking on the `Rare values` report brings us to a new page featuring data in a visualization and table format. The search bar automatically populates with the following query: `index="win_eventlogs" | rare limit=20 UserName`.
We can clearly see that the suspicious user is using character substitution to mimic the presence of another user in this demo enterprise environment.

## Q3: Which user from the HR department was observed to be running scheduled tasks?
To begin, I thought of taking  a similar approach to the last question: search by rare values. This did not work as there were so many unique values. I then used the query `index="win_eventlogs" | top limit=100 ProcessName` to accommodate all possible `ProcessName` results. Nothing stuck out as blatant malware.

From there, I thought about isolating Windows Event IDs based on scheduled tasks. A quick Google search landed me on Microsoft's official documentation page. I learned that there are a couple more scheduled task-oriented IDs. In our case, Windows Event ID 4698 pertains to scheduled task creation.

From there, we enter a new Splunk query. 

> In Splunk, the Boolean operator `AND` is always present between search terms.
{: .prompt-info }

![question3query](/Q3eventidnoresults.png) 

No results! I thought that surely would have worked. I looked through the `Interesting fields` subpane and found the `ProcessName` field. It seemed that the ID values were processed here. I entered a new query of `index="win_eventlogs" ProcessID="4698"`.

![question3query](/Q3findscheduled.png) 

Success! We get a couple of interesting hits. But how do we know which one is correct? From the question, we know that we are looking for an HR_* hostname. Fortunately, all the other results are IT_* and Admin_* hostnames. This narrows it down to our answer.

## Q4: Which user from the HR department executed a system process (LOLBIN) to download a payload from a file-sharing host?

This question was a little more difficult as it involved lengthy scrolling. Was that the most efficient way? Probably not. I had at least narrowed down my selection to the HR department by using the following query: `index="win_eventlogs" HostName="HR_*"`. After about ten minutes of frustrated scrolling, I changed tactics. I did some light reading on possibly involved tools by using the MITRE ATT&CK Framework and the LOLBAS page.

![question5noprogresslolbas](/Q5noprogresslolbas.png) 

Then it dawned on me: there must be use of the command line somewhere. I entered a new query: `index="win_eventlogs" HostName="HR_*" CommandLine="*.exe"`. There is our answer! In fact, this log entry contains everything else we need to complete this challenge room.

## Q5: To bypass the security controls, which system process (lolbin) was used to download a payload from the internet?

Answer found from the above process.

## Q6: What was the date that this binary was executed by the infected host? format (YYYY-MM-DD)

Answer found from the above process.

## Q7: Which third-party site was accessed to download the malicious payload?

Answer found from the above process.

## Q8: What is the name of the file that was saved on the host machine from the C2 server during the post-exploitation phase?

Answer found from the above process.

## Q9: The suspicious file downloaded from the C2 server contained malicious content with the pattern THM{..........}; what is that pattern?

I hesitated in navigating to the "C2 server", which happened to be a generic pastebin site. The day before, I had finished doing another investigation scenario involving defanged URLs in CyberChef. That was pretty silly on my end. I navigated to the webpage where you can clearly spot the THM{...} flag.

## Q10: What is the URL that the infected host connected to?

Answer found from the above process.

# Conclusion

And that does it for my first walkthrough/write-up. I plan on doing additional blue-team challenges as many TryHackMe investigations do not have any write-ups submitted. People tend to have more of an interest in penetration testing and red-team exercises so there are usually dozens listed for the most popular pentesting boxes. To happy times and good memories!
