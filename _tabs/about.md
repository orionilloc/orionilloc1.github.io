I am an early-career networking and security professional with a special interest in blue-team operations. I currently have a CCNA as well as a CompTIA Security+ certification. Depending on my appetite, I will eventually get around to an AWS Associate-level certification and the Blue Team Labs Level 1 Certification.

This website serves to showcase write-ups for TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and other platforms as time permits. In the future, I hope to learn more about malware analysis, reverse engineering, and digital forensics.
