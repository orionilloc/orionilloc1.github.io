I am an aspiring networking and security professional with a special interest in blue-team operations. I currently have CCNA and CompTIA Security+ certifications. Once I get a proper IT job maybe I will acquire an AWS Associate-level certification and the Blue Team Labs Level 1 Certification.

This website serves to showcase write-ups for TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and other platforms as time permits (maybe my homelab as well?). In the future, I hope to learn more about malware analysis and reverse engineering.
